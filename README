Pong by Daniel Bishop and Bethany Kaye-Blake

This directory contains the required modules for a two-player pong game. When make is run it will read Makefile
	
make		-> builds the application for the ATmega32
make program	-> programs the pong game into the ATmega32 flash memory
make clean	-> deletes the object and executable files

In order to start the game, one play must push the navswitch down. You can then set the level you wish to play out, which corresponds to the speed at which the ball moves. Once this has been set, once a player pushes the button, the game begins and the ball will bounce between the led mats until a player loses. At this point, if the player wishes to continue, they can push the navswitch to restart the game.

The directory structure is:

ball		    -> module detailing ball initialisation, movement and general game checks pertaining to the ball
game		    -> module containing the main game, supported by helper modules
paddle		    -> module detailing paddle initialisation, movement and led mat drawing
playerManagement    -> module containing functions to manage player interaction
communication	    -> module for communication between players and game setup
win		    -> module containing functions and such relating to game winning
